 * @section Introduction
 *
 * 2Geom is a computational geometry library intended for use with 2D vector graphics.
 * It concentrates on high-level algorithms, such as computing the length of a curve
 * or exact boolean operations on paths. It evolved from the geometry code used
 * in Inkscape, a free software, cross-platform vector graphics editor.

/**
 * @page Overview Overview of 2Geom
 *
 * 2Geom has two APIs: a high level one, which uses virtual functions to allow handling
 * objects of in a generic way without knowing their actual type at compile time,
 * an a lower-level one based on templates, which is designed with performance in mind.
 * For performance-critical tasks it may be necessary to use the lower level API.

 * @section Indenting
 *
 * All files should use 4 spaces as indentation.
 * 
 * @section Namespaces
 *
 * All classes intended for direct use by the end users should be in the Geom namespace.
 * Contents of namespaces should not be indented. Closing brace of a namespace
 * should have a comment indicating which namespace it is closing.
 * @code
 namespace Geom {
 namespace FooInternal {
 
 unsigned some_function()
 {
     // ...code...
 }

 } // namespace FooInternal
 } // namespace Geom
 @endcode
 * 
 * @section Classes
 *
 * @code
 // superclass list should use Boost notation,
 // especially if there is more than one.
 class Foo
     : public Bar
     , public Baz
 {
     // constructors should use Boost notation if the class has superclasses.
     Foo(int a)
         : Bar(a)
         , Baz(b)
     {
         // constructor body
     }
     Foo(int a) {
         // constructor with default initialization of superclasses
     }

     // methods use camelCaseNames.
     // one-line methods can be collapsed.
     bool isActive() { return _blurp; }
     // multi-line methods have the opening brace on the same line.
     void invert() {
         // ... code ...
     }

     // static functions use lowercase_with_underscores.
     // static factory functions should be called from_something.
     static Foo from_point(Point const &p) {
         // ...
     }
 }; // end of class Foo

 // Closing brace of a class should have the above comment.
 @endcode
 *
 * @section FreeFuns Free functions
 *
 * Functions should use lowercase_with_underscores names. The opening brace of
 * the definition should be on a separate line.

/**
 * @defgroup Transforms Transformation classes
 *
 * Each transformation class represent a set of affine transforms that is closed
 * under multiplication. Those are translation, scaling, rotation, horizontal shearing
 * and vertical shearing. Any affine transform can be obtained by combining those
 * basic operations.
 *
 * Each of the transforms can be applied to points and matrices (using multiplication).
 * Each can also be converted into a matrix (which can represent any composition
 * of transforms generically). All (except translation) use the origin (0,0) as the invariant
 * point (e.g. one that stays in the same place after applying the transform to the plane).
 * To obtain transforms with different invariant points, combine them with translation to
 * and back from the origin. For example, to get a 60 degree rotation around the point @a p:
 * @code Affine rot_around_p = Translate(-p) * Rotate::from_degrees(60) * Translate(p); @endcode
 *
 * Multiplication of transforms is associative: the result of an expression involving
 * points and matrices is the same regardless of the order of evaluating multiplications.
 *
 * If you need to transform a complicated object
 * by A, then B, and then C, you should first compute the total transform and apply it to the
 * object in one go. This way instead of performing 3 expensive operations, you will only do
 * two very fast matrix multiplications and one complex transformation. Here is an example:
 * @code
 transformed_path = long_path * A * B * C; // wrong! long_path will be transformed 3 times.
 transformed_path = long_path * (A * B * C); // good! long_path will be transformed only once.
 Affine total = A * B * C; // you can store the transform to apply it to several objects.
 transformed_path = long_path * total; // good!
   @endcode
 * Ordering note: if you compose transformations via multiplication, they are applied
 * from left to right. If you write <code> ptrans = p * A * B * C * D;</code>, then it means
 * that @a ptrans is obtained from @a p by first transforming it by A, then by B, then by C,
 * and finally by D. This is a consequence of interpreting points as row vectors, instead
 * of the more common column vector interpretation; 2Geom's choice leads to more intuitive
 * notation.

/**
 * @defgroup Primitives Geometrical primitives
 *
 * 2Geom has several basic geometrical objects: points, lines, intervals,
 * and others. Most of those objects can be treated as sets of points or numbers
 * satisfying some equation or as functions.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Curves Curves
 *
 * Curves are functions \f$\mathbf{C}: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}^2\f$. For details, see
 * the documentation for the Curve class. All curves can be included in paths and path sequences.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Shapes Basic shapes
 *
 * Among the shapes supported by 2Geom are circles, ellipses and polygons.
 * Polygons can also be represented by paths containing only linear segments.
