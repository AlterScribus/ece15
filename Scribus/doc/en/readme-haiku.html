<h2>Scribus on Haiku</h2>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of Giovanni Mugnai Scribus is also available for Haiku.</p>

<p>To run Scribus on Haiku you need to <a href="http://haikuware.com/directory/view-details/productivity/desktop-publishing/scribus-publishing-and-layout">download</a> Scribus for Haiku, which comes in a ZIP archive. Extract the archive to Haiku&rsquo;s <code>/boot</code> directory. The archive includes all dependencies. It also contains the latest versions of Ghostscript and LittleCMS, so these need not be installed separately.</p>

<p>After extraction, an icon/link to Scribus will be present on the Desktop, and you can launch Scribus.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since CUPS hasn&rsquo;t been ported to Haiku yet, you can&rsquo;t print directly from Scribus. You can, however, export a PDF and print from BePDF or DocumentViewer.</li>

<li>The Scripter doesn&rsquo;t work, because Python Tkinter is currently not available for Haiku.</li>
