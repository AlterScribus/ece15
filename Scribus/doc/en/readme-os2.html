<h2>Scribus on OS/2 and eComStation</h2>
Thanks to Paul Smedley, the Scribus Team is happy to provide a port of Scribus to OS/2 and its successor eComStation.

<h2>Downloads</h2>
<h3>Scribus 1.3.3.x Stable</h3>
<p>The latest port of Scribus 1.3.3x is available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus/">Sourceforge</a>. Please select the ZIP archive with "os2" in the file name for download. The archive contains a folder called "scribus," in which you find an installer called "scribus.exe".</p>
<h3>Scribus 1.3.6+ Development</h3>
<p>You can download a ZIP archive containing an installer for the development version either from</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scribus/files/scribus-devel/1.3.6/scribus-1.3.6-os2-20100329.zip/download">Sourceforge</a> or <a href="http://download.smedley.info/scribus-1.3.6-os2-20100329.zip">Paul Smedley's Unix Ports for OS/2 site</a>.</p>

<h2>Other requirements</h2>
<p>To run Scribus you need at least OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation. Scribus will not run on older versions of OS/2.</p>
<p>In addition, please note that you need to install the following software:</p>

<ul>
<li>A copy of libc063.dll, which can currently be downloaded from <a href="ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0.6.3-csd3.zip">ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/gcc/libc-0.6.3-csd3.zip</a> and gcc434.dll, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://download.smedley.info/gcc434.zip">http://download.smedley.info/gcc434.zip</a>. Both files need to copied to C:\OS2\DLL (OS/2) or C:\ECS\DLL (eComStation).</li>

<li>Ghostscript and Python 2.6 (available from <a href="http://os2ports.smedley.info">http://os2ports.smedley.info</a>) are required to support some functionality. For instance, Python scripts won't work if Python is missing. The print preview and EPS import will not work if Ghostscript isn't available.

If Scribus doesn't detect Ghostscript automatically, you can set the path to the GS exectutable (called "gsos2.exe") in the Scribus Preferences under "External Tools."
</li>

<li>Scribus 1.3.6 or later also requires the Qt4 GA dll's that can be downloaded as a WarpIn package from <a href="http://svn.netlabs.org/qt4">http://svn.netlabs.org/qt4</a></li>.
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Printing support to "normal" OS/2 printers is not complete, but PDF export is. You can easily print via Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer as a temporary workaround.</li>
<li>Printing to CUPS printers is supported. <i>File > Print</i> will detect all available CUPS printers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>The Scribus Team is much obliged to Paul Smedley for taking pains over porting Scribus to the OS/2 and eComStation platforms.</p>
<p>The Scribus Team also wants to thank <a href="http://www.serenity-systems.com/">Serenity Systems</a> for supporting development and testing of the OS/2 and eComStation port.</p>
