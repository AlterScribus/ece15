This README is strictly about changes to the online manual for Scribus Version 
1.5.0svn.

The English manual now uses CSS
===============================

Perhaps related to some changes in the helpbrowser, the appearance of the 
manual changed in 1.5.0, with a larger Serif font, and no ability to adjust 
this from the browser. After some experimentation, it was decided to start 
using CSS to have better control over the appearance, as well as allow the user 
to edit this appearance if desired.

manual.css
==========
This is the name of the external CSS file, which you will find in doc/en in the 
SVN download. 

**********
h1 {font-family:fontin,sans-serif; font-size:1.3em;}
h2 {font-family:fontin,sans-serif; font-size:1.2em;}
h3 {font-family:fontin,sans-serif; font-size:1.1em;}
h4 {font-family:fontin,sans-serif; font-size:1em;}

p, blockquote {font-family:dejavu sans,sans-serif; font-size:0.8em;}
li {font-family:dejavu sans,sans-serif; font-size:0.8em;}
code {font-size:1.1em;}
dl {font-family:dejavu sans, sans-serif; font-size:1em;}
pre {font-size:0.9em;}
**********

Using Fontin for headers is just a suggestion. It is an attractive, freely 
available and usable font, but does not allow free distribution, so you must 
obtain it on your own.

How manual.css is used
======================

Inside the HTML files in doc/en, each HTML file has this after the <head> tags:

<style>
@import "manual.css";
</style>

This allows for simply editing the external stylesheet file to accomplish 
widespread changes throughout the manual.

If you delete manual.css from your end destination, the manual will revert to 
the default font.
